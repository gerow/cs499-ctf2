==========

second capture the flag assignment for security class

In this assignment we were tasked with creating exploits for a php script running under apache in order to create a denial of service and to defend against it for our own server.  It was played out in a competetive style with us attacking another team and defending our own server from a third team.

Our attack using a syn flood with very large payload ended up working quite well and we ended up winning the competition.
